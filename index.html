            <p class="def1">Love can be a challenge to define at the level of how a person experiences it. Love can
                involve
                personal
                affection, sexual attraction, platonic admiration, brotherly loyalty, benevolent concern, or worshipful
                adoration. To accurately answer the question “what is love?” we need to go to the origin of love. The
                Holly Quran
                tells us that "Be good. Verily, Allah loves those who are good.".</p>
            <p class="def1">
                In English language, the word love is forced to bear the burden of a multitude of meanings. We “love”
                everything from pancakes to parents, but in vastly different ways. You will not enter Paradise until you
                believe and you will not believe until you love each other. Shall I show you something that, if you did,
                you would love each other? Spread peace between yourselves.

                    Loving yourself is the most productive thing you can do for you life because all that doubt, self
                    hate and underestimating is holding you back from reaching your full potential and of course, true
                    happiness.
                </p>
                <p class="def1">
                    You can’t truly be happy if you don’t love yourself because no matter how happy everything else in
                    your life is, you will always feel unworthy, like you don’t deserve happiness. To love yourself
                    isn’t arrogant or grandiose, from a young age we have been taught that to love yourself is to be
                    selfish, wrong, arrogant, patronizing, unattractive and unproductive.

                        Seek forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance. For my Lord is indeed merciful and

                        "Put him in a wooden box and cast it in the river. The river will cast it on the bank. An enemy
                        of Ours, and his, will retrieve it." We bestowed Our love on you that you may be reared under
                        Our eyes. (Quran 20:39, Ahmed Ali)

                        And He is the Forgiving and Loving One. (Quran 84:14, Wahiduddin Khan)

                        Say, "If you love God, follow me and God will love you and forgive you your sins. God is most

                        You tell them: "If your fathers and sons, your brothers and wives and families and wealth, or
                        the business you fear may fail, and the mansions that you love, are dearer to you than God, His

                        show transgressors the way." (Quran 9:24, Ahmed Ali)
